# ImageCaptioning
**Image Captioning** is a field that intersects computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), where the goal is to generate an accurate and meaningful textual description of an image. In other words, the task is to design a model that automatically produces a caption for an image, similar to how a human might describe it.
